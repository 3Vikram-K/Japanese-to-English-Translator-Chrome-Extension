# Japanese-to-English-Translator-Chrome-Extension
A Chrome extension that can translate any selected Japanese text to English and vice versa. 

I have used the Text Translator API by DEVISITY from Rapid API

It is a free to use api and you can create an account and subscribe to it.

Then paste your key in the service-worker.js to be able to translate.
